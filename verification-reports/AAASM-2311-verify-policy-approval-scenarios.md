## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

### ✅ `scenarios/policy-enforcement` exists and is runnable

Introduced in PR #26 (AAASM-2296). Directory structure:

```
scenarios/policy-enforcement/
  policy.yaml               ← 4 rules (2 allow, 2 deny), default_action: deny
  expected-output.txt
  README.md
  python/                   ← PR #26
  node/                     ← PR #29
  go/                       ← PR #32
```

All three language implementations run offline without a gateway or API key.

### ✅ `scenarios/approval-gates` exists and is runnable

Introduced in PR #33 (AAASM-2308). Directory structure:

```
scenarios/approval-gates/
  policy.yaml               ← 2 rules (allow + approval_required), default_action: deny
  expected-output.txt
  README.md
  python/                   ← PR #33
  node/                     ← PR #34
```

### ✅ Policy files are committed and documented

- `scenarios/policy-enforcement/policy.yaml` — 4 rules with `action`, `reason` fields; `default_action: deny`
- `scenarios/approval-gates/policy.yaml` — 2 rules including `approval_required` action; `default_action: deny`
- Both files are walked through in their scenario READMEs

### ✅ Expected output files or README output blocks are included

- `scenarios/policy-enforcement/expected-output.txt` — shows ALLOW/DENY output for 4 tool calls
- `scenarios/policy-enforcement/README.md` — includes "Expected output" section
- `scenarios/approval-gates/expected-output.txt` — shows pending → approved → executed flow
- `scenarios/approval-gates/README.md` — includes "Expected output" section

### ✅ At least Python and Node.js implementations exist for both scenarios

| Scenario | Python | Node.js |
|---|---|---|
| `policy-enforcement` | ✅ PR #26 | ✅ PR #29 |
| `approval-gates` | ✅ PR #33 | ✅ PR #34 |

### ✅ Go policy enforcement example exists

`scenarios/policy-enforcement/go/` added in PR #32 (AAASM-2301).

Uses `assembly.WrapTools()` + `policyClient` implementing `assembly.GovernanceClient`, consistent with the `go/tool-policy` example pattern.

### ✅ CI verifies all implemented scenario paths

`.github/workflows/verify-scenarios.yml` added in PR #35 (AAASM-2310). Five jobs:

| Job | Working directory | Command |
|---|---|---|
| `policy-enforcement / python` | `scenarios/policy-enforcement/python` | `uv run pytest tests/ -v` |
| `policy-enforcement / node` | `scenarios/policy-enforcement/node` | `pnpm test` |
| `policy-enforcement / go` | `scenarios/policy-enforcement/go` | `go test ./...` |
| `approval-gates / python` | `scenarios/approval-gates/python` | `uv run pytest tests/ -v` |
| `approval-gates / node` | `scenarios/approval-gates/node` | `pnpm test` |

Triggers on `scenarios/**` path changes and on push to master.

### ✅ Root README links these scenarios as the best product-value examples

Updated in PR #35 (AAASM-2310). The "Quick navigation" table now links directly to:
- `./scenarios/policy-enforcement/README.md` for the "Explore policy enforcement" row
- `./scenarios/approval-gates/README.md` for the "Understand approval gates" row

The "Repository layout" section shows both sub-directories under `scenarios/`.

### ✅ No secrets or `.env` files committed

All examples are fully offline and use mock data. No `.env` files, API keys, or gateway URLs are committed. Tool functions return hardcoded mock values (config values, agent IDs, account balances).
